Re: Freedom of Information Act Request

Dear ______________:

This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act.

I request that a copy of the following documents or documents containing the following information be provided to me:

Market Makers specifically provide market liquidity

Documentation and procedures for auditing bone-fide Market Makers and Broker-Dealers to ensure market integrity of share counts.



In order to help to determine my status to assess fees, you should know that I am an individual seeking information for personal use and not for a commercial use.


I request a waiver of all fees for this request. Disclosure of the requested information to me is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in my commercial interest. The resultant information will be shared to a large group of retail investors for due diligence and lively debate on several internet chat forums. The disclosed procedures and documentation will provide for education and debate to an estimated group of at least 250,000 individuals.


Thank you for your consideration of this request.

Sincerely,



Name

City, State, Zip Code
